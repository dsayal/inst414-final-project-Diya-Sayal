INST414 Final Project - Diya Sayal

Cyber Security Breaches Analysis

Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of managing and analyzing data breaches within the cybersecurity sector. The goal is to leverage data analysis to uncover insights and patterns related to data breaches, ultimately helping to improve data management and security practices.

Business Problem:
The focus is on identifying gaps and trends in data breach incidents, specifically within the healthcare sector. By analyzing historical breach data, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can enhance data protection strategies and mitigate risks.

Datasets Used
databreaches.csv: Contains information about various data breaches, including entity names, breach methods, and sources.
cyberbreaches.csv: Provides descriptions and details for each column in the dataset.
Cyberbreaches_DD.xlsx: Contains metadata and definitions for the columns in the cyberbreaches.csv dataset.
Techniques Employed
ETL Pipeline: Extracted, transformed, and loaded data to prepare it for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and transformed the data into a suitable format for analysis.
Machine Learning: Utilized Decision Trees to classify and analyze breach data, aiming to predict and understand breach patterns.
Expected Outputs
Analyzed Data: Results in CSV format, detailing insights and trends identified from the data.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts illustrating breach patterns and trends.
Trained Model: A machine learning model for predictive analysis, including the trained model file and performance metrics.
