INST414 Final Project
# Cyber Security Breaches Analysis
# Data Breach Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to address the business problem of managing and analyzing data breaches in the cybersecurity sector. The objective is to use data analysis to uncover insights and patterns related to data breaches, which can help improve data management and security practices.

**Business Problem:**  
The project focuses on identifying gaps and trends in data breach incidents in healthcare to enhance data protection strategies. It utilizes historical breach data to provide actionable insights.

**Datasets Used:**
- `databreaches.csv`: Contains information about various data breaches, including entity names, breach methods, and sources.
- `cyberbreaches.csv`: `Cyberbreaches_DD.xlsx` provides descriptions and details for each column in the dataset.

**Techniques Employed:**
- **ETL Pipeline**: Extracted and processed data for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and transformed data into a suitable format.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied Decision Trees to classify and analyze breach data.

**Expected Outputs:**
- Analyzed data in CSV format.
- Visualizations of breach patterns and trends.
- Trained machine learning model for predictive analysis.
